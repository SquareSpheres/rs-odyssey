# rs-odyssey

> A progressive Rust learning journey through 6 hands-on projects

## 🎯 Overview

This repository documents my journey learning Rust through increasingly complex projects, from basic networking to a full WebRTC application.

**Learning Rule:** No AI-generated code – only self-directed learning, research, and problem-solving.
